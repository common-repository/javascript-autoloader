Load JavaScript files without coding

== Description ==

The Smart JavaScript Auto Loader Plugin allows you to load additional JavaScript files without the need to change files in the theme directory

== Retired Plugin ==

Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you. 

There will be no more updates and I won't answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.

Feel free to fork this plugin.

== Usage ==

To load additional JavaScript files just put them into a directory named **jsautoload**. This directory can be placed in three different locations that are loaded in the following order:

* Child Theme dependent (if using a Child Theme) : in the Child Theme's directory
* Theme dependent : in the Theme's directory
* Theme independent : in the wp-content directory

Only files with extension .js are added, all other files are ignored. Subdirectories can be used and will also be scanned. To ignore a complete directory (including all subdirectories) name the directory beginning with an underscore (_). The files are added in alphabetical order. Directories always are added **after** files. 

To load one ore more JavaScript files at the end of your HTML file just place them into a directory named **footer**. To add the files to the footer of your theme it is required to call wp_footer() in your footer.php.
